Writing Open Source Ecosystem for DL/RL research is challenging.<br/>
Let's explain why we are doing this.

### Why?
For real breakthroughs in DL/RL area, we need a Foundation.<br/>
For DL/RL Foundation, we need an Open Source R&D Ecosystem.<br/>
The Catalyst was designed by researchers for researchers,
- to get the foundation for DL & RL research, which would be well tested and verified
- to generalize and develop best practices that work in all areas of DL
- to think less about the tech-side and focus on research hypothesis and their value
- to accelerate your research

### What?
We are creating a research Ecosystem, which
- combines research best practices and helps knowledge sharing
- connects DL/RL with Software Engineer for maximum performance
- allows quickly and efficiently validate your hypotheses

### How?
- open – it's entirely Open Source Ecosystem
- equivalently – everyone can contribute, propose new ideas, have their own options
- expertise – we are gathering top knowledge into one place
- high-performance – we are developing the ecosystem with SE best practices
