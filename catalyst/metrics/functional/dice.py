    Args:
        outputs: [N; K; ...] tensor that for each of the N examples
            indicates the probability of the example belonging to each of
            the K classes, according to the model.
        targets:  binary [N; K; ...] tensort that encodes which of the K
            classes are associated with the N-th input
        class_dim: indicates class dimention (K) for
            ``outputs`` and ``targets`` tensors (default = 1)

        eps: epsilon to avoid zero division
