# Contribution guide

## How to start?

Contributing is quite easy: suggest ideas and make them done.
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

Every good PR usually consists of:
- feature implementation :)
- documentation to describe this feature to other people
- tests to ensure everything is implemented correctly
- `CHANGELOG.md` update for framework development history

### PR examples
You can check these examples as good practices to follow.

## Step-by-step guide

### Before the PR
Please ensure that you have read the following docs:
- [documentation and FAQ](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/)
- [minimal examples section](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples)
- [changelog with main framework updates](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### New feature

1. Make an issue with your feature description;
2. We shall discuss the design and its implementation details;
3. Once we agree that the plan looks good, go ahead and implement it.


### Bugfix

1. Goto [GitHub issues](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues);
2. Pick an issue and comment on the task that you want to work on this feature;
3. If you need more context on a specific issue, please ask, and we will discuss the details.

You can also join our [Catalyst slack](https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw) to make it easier to discuss.
Once you finish implementing a feature or bugfix, please send a Pull Request.

## Contribution best practices

1. Install requirements
    ```bash
    # for MacOS users, as we need bash version >= 4.0.0, wget and gnu-based sed
    brew install bash wget gnu-sed

    # It is often useful to have one or more Python environments 
    # where you can experiment with different combinations 
    # of packages without affecting your main installation. 
    # Create the virtual conda environment
    conda create --name catalyst_dev
    conda activate catalyst_dev # or ``source activate catalyst_dev``
    
    # Install the required dependencies
    pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
    
    # for easy-to-go development, we suggest installing all extra dependencies
    # that's why the independent conda environment is preferable 
    # Catalyst has a lot of extensions :)
    pip install \
      -r requirements/requirements.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-cv.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-hydra.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-ml.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-mlflow.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-nifti.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-onnx.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-optuna.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-neptune.txt \
      -r requirements/requirements-albu.txt
    ```
2. Break your work into small, single-purpose updates if possible.
It's much harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint features.
3. Submit the update as a GitHub pull request against the `master` branch.
4. Make sure that you provide docstrings for all your new methods and classes.
5. Add new unit tests for your code ([PR examples](#pr-examples)).
6. Check the [codestyle](#codestyle)
7. Make sure that your code [passes the Github CI](#github-ci)


## Github CI

We are using the Github CI for our test cases validation:

- [codestyle tests](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/.github/workflows/codestyle.yml#L134)
- [documentation tests](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/.github/workflows/codestyle.yml#L135)
- [unit tests](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/.github/workflows/dl_cpu.yml#L113)
- [integrations tests](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/.github/workflows/dl_cpu.yml#L114#L117)

We also have a [colab minimal CI/CD](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JCGTVvWlrIsLXMPRRRSWiAstSLic4nbA) as an independent step-by-step handmade tests option.
Please use it as a collaborative platform, if you have any issues during the PR.

### Codestyle

We also have our own [catalyst-codestyle](https://github.com/catalyst-team/codestyle) 
package to help with code formatting issues.

You could check the codestyle for your PR with:

```bash
catalyst-make-codestyle && catalyst-check-codestyle
```

Once again, make sure that your python packages complied with `requirements/requirements.txt` and `requirements/requirements-dev.txt` to get codestyle run clean:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
```

### Documentation

Catalyst uses [Google style](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for formatting [docstrings](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).
Length of a line inside docstrings block must be limited to 100 characters to fit into Jupyter documentation popups.

How to setup Google style documentation style in PyCharm:
[![Catalyst logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catalyst-team/catalyst-pics/master/third_party_pics/pycharm-google-style.png)](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst)

You could check the docs with:
```bash
rm -rf ./builds; REMOVE_BUILDS=0 make check-docs
```

Now you could open them into your browser, for example with
```bash
open ./builds/index.html
```

If you have some issues with building docs - please make sure that you installed the required pip packages.

### Tests

Do not forget to check that your code passes the unit tests:
```bash
pytest .
```

#### Adding new tests

Please follow [PR examples](#pr-examples) for best practices.

### Integrations

If you have contributed a new functionality with extra dependencies, 
please ensure you have submitted the required tests. 
Please follow [PR examples](#pr-examples) for best practices 
and review current [integrations tests](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/.github/workflows/dl_cpu.yml#L114#L117).
