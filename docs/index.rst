PyTorch framework for Deep Learning research and development.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It focuses on reproducibility, rapid experimentation, and codebase reuse
so you can **create** something new rather than write another regular train loop.
Break the cycle - use the Catalyst_!

Overview
----------------------------------------
Catalyst helps you write compact
but full-featured Deep Learning pipelines in a few lines of code.
You get a training loop with metrics, early-stopping, model checkpointing
and other features without the boilerplate.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common installation:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -U catalyst


More specific with additional requirements:

.. code:: bash

    pip install catalyst[cv]         # installs CV-based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[nlp]        # installs NLP-based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[ecosystem]  # installs Catalyst.Ecosystem
    # and master version installation
    pip install git+https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst@master --upgrade


Catalyst is compatible with: Python 3.6+. PyTorch 1.1+.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04, macOS 10.15, Windows 10 and Windows Subsystem for Linux.


Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **callbacks** - a variety of callbacks for your train-loop customization.
- **contrib** - additional modules contributed by Catalyst users.
- **core** - framework core with main abstractions - Experiment, Runner and Callback.
- **data** - useful tools and scripts for data processing.
- **dl** - entrypoint for your deep learning experiments.
- **experiments** - a number of useful experiments extensions for Notebook and Config API.
- **metrics** – classic ML and CV/NLP/RecSys metrics.
- **registry** - Catalyst global registry for Config API.
- **runners** - runners extensions for different deep learning tasks.
- **tools** - extra tools for Deep Learning research, class-based helpers.
- **utils** - typical utils for Deep Learning research, function-based helpers.


Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All Catalyst code, features and pipelines `are fully tested`_
with our own `catalyst-codestyle`_.

In fact, we train a number of different models for various of tasks -
image classification, image segmentation, text classification, GANs training
and much more.
During the tests, we compare their convergence metrics in order to verify
the correctness of the training procedure and its reproducibility.

As a result, Catalyst provides fully tested and reproducible
best practices for your deep learning research.
