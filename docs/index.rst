High-level utils for PyTorch DL & RL research.
It was developed with a focus on reproducibility,
fast experimentation and code/ideas reusing.
Being able to research/develop something new,
rather then write another regular train loop.

Break the cycle - use the Catalyst_!

Catalyst is compatible with: Python 3.6+. PyTorch 1.0.0+.


Installation
------------
Common installation:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -U catalyst


More specific with additional requirements:

.. code:: bash

    pip install catalyst[dl] # installs DL based catalyst with Weights & Biases support
    pip install catalyst[rl] # installs DL+RL based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[drl] # installs DL+RL based catalyst with Weights & Biases support
    pip install catalyst[contrib] # installs DL+contrib based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[nlp] # installs DL+NLP based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[all] # installs everything. Very convenient to deploy on a new server


Catalyst is compatible with: Python 3.6+. PyTorch 1.0.0+.

Overview
--------

Catalyst helps you write compact
but full-featured DL & RL pipelines in a few lines of code.
You get a training loop with metrics, early-stopping, model checkpointing
and other features without the boilerplate.

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Universal train/inference loop.
-  Configuration files for model/data hyperparameters.
-  Reproducibility – all source code and environment variables will be saved.
-  Callbacks – reusable train/inference pipeline parts.
-  Training stages support.
-  Easy customization.
- PyTorch best practices (SWA, AdamW, Ranger optimizer, OneCycleLRWithWarmup, FP16 and more)

Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **DL** – runner for training and inference,
   all of the classic machine learning and computer vision metrics
   and a variety of callbacks for training, validation
   and inference of neural networks.
-  **RL** – scalable Reinforcement Learning,
   on-policy & off-policy algorithms and their improvements
   with distributed training support.
-  **contrib** - additional modules contributed by Catalyst users.
-  **data** - useful tools and scripts for data processing.


Getting started: 30 seconds with Catalyst
------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import torch
    from catalyst.dl.experiments import SupervisedRunner

    # experiment setup
    logdir = "./logdir"
    num_epochs = 42

    # data
    loaders = {"train": ..., "valid": ...}

    # model, criterion, optimizer
    model = Net()
    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer)

    # model runner
    runner = SupervisedRunner()

    # model training
    runner.train(
        model=model,
        criterion=criterion,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        scheduler=scheduler,
        loaders=loaders,
        logdir=logdir,
        num_epochs=num_epochs,
        verbose=True
