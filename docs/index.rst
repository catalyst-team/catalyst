PyTorch framework for Deep Learning research and development.
It was developed with a focus on reproducibility,
fast experimentation and code/ideas reusing.
Being able to research/develop something new,
rather than write another regular train loop.

Break the cycle - use the Catalyst_!

Overview
----------------------------------------
Catalyst helps you write compact
but full-featured Deep Learning pipelines in a few lines of code.
You get a training loop with metrics, early-stopping, model checkpointing
and other features without the boilerplate.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common installation:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -U catalyst


More specific with additional requirements:

.. code:: bash

    pip install catalyst[ml]         # installs DL+ML based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[cv]         # installs DL+CV based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[nlp]        # installs DL+NLP based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[ecosystem]  # installs Catalyst.Ecosystem
    pip install catalyst[contrib]    # installs DL+contrib based catalyst
    pip install catalyst[all]        # installs everything
    # and master version installation
    pip install git+https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst@master --upgrade


Catalyst is compatible with: Python 3.6+. PyTorch 1.0.0+.

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Universal train/inference loop.
- Configuration files for model/data hyperparameters.
- Reproducibility – all source code and environment variables will be saved.
- Callbacks – reusable train/inference pipeline parts with easy customization.
- Training stages support.
- Deep Learning best practices - SWA, AdamW, Ranger optimizer, OneCycle, and more.
- Developments best practices - fp16 support, distributed training, slurm.

Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **contrib** - additional modules contributed by Catalyst users.
- **core** - framework core with main abstractions - Experiment, Runner, Callback and State.
- **data** - useful tools and scripts for data processing.
- **dl** – runner for training and inference, all of the classic ML and CV/NLP/RecSys metrics and a variety of callbacks for training, validation and inference of neural networks.
- **utils** - typical utils for Deep Learning research.

Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All the Catalyst code is `tested rigorously with every new PR`_.

In fact, we train a number of different models for various of tasks -
image classification, image segmentation, text classification, GAN training.
During the tests, we compare their convergence metrics in order to verify
the correctness of the training procedure and its reproducibility.

Overall, Catalyst guarantees fully tested, correct and reproducible
best practices for the automated parts.
