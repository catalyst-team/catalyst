PyTorch framework for Deep Learning R&D.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It focuses on reproducibility, rapid experimentation, and codebase reuse
so you can **create** something new rather than write another regular train loop.
Break the cycle - use the Catalyst_!

Overview
----------------------------------------
Catalyst helps you write compact
but full-featured Deep Learning pipelines in a few lines of code.
You get a training loop with metrics, early-stopping, model checkpointing
and other features without the boilerplate.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common installation:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -U catalyst


More specific with additional requirements:

.. code:: bash

    pip install catalyst[ml]         # installs ML-based Catalyst
    pip install catalyst[cv]         # installs CV-based Catalyst
    pip install catalyst[nlp]        # installs NLP-based Catalyst
    # master version installation
    pip install git+https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst@master --upgrade


Catalyst is compatible with: Python 3.6+. PyTorch 1.1+.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04, macOS 10.15, Windows 10 and Windows Subsystem for Linux.


Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Universal train/inference loop.
- Configuration files for model/data hyperparameters.
- Reproducibility – all source code and environment variables will be saved.
- Callbacks – reusable train/inference pipeline parts with easy customization.
- Training stages support.
- Deep Learning best practices - SWA, AdamW, Ranger optimizer, OneCycle, and more.
- Developments best practices - fp16 support, distributed training, slurm support.


Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All Catalyst code, features and pipelines `are fully tested`_
with our own `catalyst-codestyle`_.

In fact, we train a number of different models for various of tasks -
image classification, image segmentation, text classification, GANs training
and much more.
During the tests, we compare their convergence metrics in order to verify
the correctness of the training procedure and its reproducibility.

As a result, Catalyst provides fully tested and reproducible
best practices for your deep learning research.
