Issues
------

We use `GitHub issues`_ for bug reports and feature requests.

Step-by-step guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New feature
'''''''''''

1. Make an issue with your feature description;
2. We shall discuss the design and its implementation details;
3. Once we agree that the plan looks good, go ahead and implement it.

Bugfix
''''''

1. Goto `GitHub issues`_;
2. Pick an issue and comment on the task that you want to work on this
   feature;
3. If you need more context on a specific issue, please ask, and we will
   discuss the details.

Once you finish implementing a feature or bugfix, please send a Pull
Request.

Contribution best practices
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

1. Break your work into small, single-purpose updates if possible. Itâ€™s
   much harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint
   features.
2. Submit the update as a GitHub pull request against the ``dev``
   branch.
3. Make sure that your code passes the unit tests.
4. Add new unit tests for your code.

Codestyle
^^^^^^^^^

Do not forget to check the codestyle for your PR with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make check-style



Documentation
-------------

Catalyst uses `Google style`_ for formatting `docstrings`_. Length of line
inside docstrings block must be limited to 80 characters to fit into
Jupyter documentation popups.
