Engine
==============================================================================

``Engine`` is the main force of the ``Runner``.
It defines the logic of hardware communication and different deep learning techniques usage
like distributed or half-precision training:

Thanks to the ``Engine`` design,
itâ€™s straightforward to adapt your pipeline for different hardware accelerators.
For example, you could easily support:

- `PyTorch distribute setup`_.
- `Nvidia-Apex setup`_.
- `AMP distributed setup`_.

Moreover, we are working on other hardware accelerators support like DeepSpeed, Horovod, or TPU.
You could watch the progress of engine development under the `Engine API section`_.
