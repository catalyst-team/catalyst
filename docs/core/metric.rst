Metric
==============================================================================

Catalyst API also involves ``Metric`` abstraction
for convenient metric computation during an experiment run. Its API is quite simple:

You could find all the supported metrics under the `Metric API section`_.

Catalyst Metric API has a default `update` and `compute` methods
to support per-batch statistic accumulation and final computation during training.
All metrics also support `update` and `compute` key-value extensions
for convenient usage during the run â€” it gives you the flexibility
to store any number of metrics or aggregations you want
with a simple communication protocol to use for their logging.
