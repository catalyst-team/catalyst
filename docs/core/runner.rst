Runner
==============================================================================

Runner — an abstraction that knows **how** to run an experiment.
It contains all the logic of how to work with your model per-
stage, epoch, and batch.

From my experience, deep learning experiments follow the same for-loop
(how to run):

.. code-block:: python

    for stage in experiment.stages:
        for epoch in stage.epochs:
            for loader in epoch.loaders:
                for batch in loader:
                    handle_batch(batch)

The only thing that we want to change in these pipelines
for new data/model is batch-handler.
This is exactly what our Runner is doing –
it goes through stages and runs a common train-loop +
extra tricks for reproducibility.
