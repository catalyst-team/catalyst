Logger
==============================================================================

Speaking about the logging, Catalyst united the monitoring system API support into one abstraction:

With such a simple API,
we already provide integrations for `Tensorboard`_, `MLFlow`_, Comet, Neptune and Wandb monitoring systems.
All currently supported loggers you could find under the `Logger API section`_.
